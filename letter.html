    <h1>ðŸ’Œ Your Letter</h1>
    <p>Hi love,</p>
    <p>It's an apology â€” about earlier, the girlfriend things. I just came to know today is Girlfriend Day so I thought to write in that way to you. I know it was too forward and uncomfortable for you, and I'm sorry. I was just overwhelmed â€” Iâ€™m sorry.</p>
    <p>I know very well that youâ€™re not my girlfriend (yet), and I should have been more thoughtful with my words. I understand that feelings should be expressed with respect, not assumption.</p>
    <p>Youâ€™re someone I deeply admire â€” for who you are, the way you carry yourself, and the light you carry even when things are hard. And I guess sometimes, my heart races ahead while my role in your life is still growing, slowly and patiently.</p>
    <p>I donâ€™t expect anything in return. I just want you to feel safe, respected, and never pressured. Thatâ€™s the kind of love I believe in â€” the one that waits, listens, and protects.</p>
    <p>Again, I'm sorry. Please ignore if you don't like or if you found that too forward... but since you're still reading â€” hehe ðŸ’—</p>
    <p><strong>"I LOVE YOU"</strong></p>
    <p>I don't know if I have the right words, but I do know I have the right heart. And that heart has quietly but deeply fallen for you.</p>
    <p>I love you:
    <br />- The way you speak.
    <br />- The way you carry your faith.
    <br />- The way you feel deeply and yet stay strong.
    <br />- The way you donâ€™t even realize how much light you bring into my world.</p>
    <p>You don't need to be perfect to be loved deeply. Come to me with your messy hair, morning face, tired soul, blank mind â€” all the things you call insecurity â€” and Iâ€™ll show you the love that loves you unconditionally.</p>
    <p>You are worthy. Of peace. Of joy. Of being loved as you are.
    <br />And if someday, your heart decides to let someone inâ€¦
    <br />Iâ€™ll be right here â€” with steady hands, a loyal heart, and a love that already sees all of you and still chooses you, fully.</p>
    <p>I donâ€™t love you with expectation.
    <br />I donâ€™t love you with pressure.
    <br />I love you with patience.
    <br />With respect.
    <br />With hope â€” that maybe someday, youâ€™ll see me the way I already see you.</p>
    <p>But if that day never comes, thatâ€™s okay too.
    <br />Because knowing you, caring for you, and loving you â€” even in silence â€” is already a kind of happiness I never thought Iâ€™d find.</p>
    <p class="signature">With all that I am,<br />Aditya Kashyap</p>
